The following is a repository that contains Latexify. 

LaTeXify aims to provide a local and free solution for converting complex
mathematical functions from images into LaTeX format. This tool addresses the limitations of
current paid solutions that require high computational costs and are not open-source. By offering
an efficient and accessible alternative, LaTeXify is especially useful for researchers, educators, and
students in scientific fields. It makes the process of mathematical documentation more efficient,
enhancing productivity and communication in academic and technical environments.

The results of Latexify and explanation of the arquitecture are in the Project Report.
